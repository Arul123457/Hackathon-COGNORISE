# Hackathon-COGNORISE

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handling Categorical Data: Convert categorical variables such as 'Gender', 'Section', 'Parental level of education', 'Lunch', and 'Test preparation course' into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Engineering: Consider creating new features that may help in prediction, such as combining scores, calculating averages, or generating binary flags for specific categories.
Missing Values: Check for and handle any missing values, if present, through imputation or removal.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution Analysis: Visualize the distribution of the exam scores and other numerical features.
Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between the exam score and other features using correlation matrices or scatter plots.

3. Model Selection:

Start with simple regression models like Linear Regression.
Experiment with more complex models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines.
I am choosing Random Forests
Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

4. Evaluation:

Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared to evaluate the model's performance.
Compare different models based on these metrics and choose the best-performing one.
